    <p>As expected the weather becomes significantly warmer as one approaches the equator (0 Deg. latitude). More interestingly, however, is the fact that the souther hemisphere tends to be warmer this time of year than the northern hemisphere. This may be due to the tilt of the earth at the time of the year this data was gathered.</p>
    <p>A simple Google search can tell that weather becomes significantly warmer as one approaches the equator (0 Deg. Latitude) and thus this data backs up that notion. Something I found that was quite interesting is the fact that the southern hemisphere tends to be warmer this time of year than the northern hemisphere. My possible explanation of this could be due to the tilt of the earth.</p>
